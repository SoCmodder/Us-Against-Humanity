    <string name="dialog_message">Hey guys! We just wanted to say sorry about all of the wonky issues that we\'ve been having with the server. We know have it all set up in a dedicated location and we shouldn\'t have to do another wipe. With that being said, unfortunately you\'ll have to make a new account. If you have any suggestions or card ideas, feel free to email me at: socmodder@gmail.com. Thanks for downloading Black and White! Enjoy! - The Black and White Team</string>
